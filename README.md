## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I have used Absolute and Relative positioning. This was a first for m. I found it very finikey and time consuming so I am unsure if there is a more efficent way to do layouts. 

I also learnt about overflow and hidden. 

### Continued development

I am still stuggling with getting the layout to be exactly like the solution. There is still a small white border/margin around the product picture and I cannot figure out what to change to get rid of it. 

I am also interested to know if there is a better way to layout components than just using tables.
